# Deep_Learning_Alzheimers_Disease

The aim of this project was to build an attention-based multimodal deep learning model for the classification of AD, MCI and normal controls using imaging and clinical data.

Data was taken from the open-source Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
The Multimodal Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis framework (MADDi) was used for the training: see https://github.com/rsinghlab/MADDi 

This was a group project completed between Aug-Dec 2022 for the Joint Masters of Health Informatics programme at Karolinska Institute/Stockholm university.
